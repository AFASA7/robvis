## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Omitted the redundant 'Quickly' from the title field of the DESCRIPTION file
* Added links to relevant references to the description field of the DESCRIPTION

## Test environments
* Windows 10 (local), R 3.5.0 
* Ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), devel and release
* win-builder, devel and release
* Windows x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit) (on AppVeyor), devel and release

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
