Description: Helps users in quickly visualising risk-of-bias 
    assessments performed as part of a systematic review. It allows users to 
    create weighted bar-plots of the distribution of risk-of-bias judgements 
    within each bias domain, in addition to “traffic light” plots of the 
    specific domain-level judgements for each study. The resulting figures are 
    of publication quality and are formatted according the risk-of-bias 
    assessment tool use to perform the assessments. Currently, the supported 
    tools are ROB2.0 (for randomised controlled trials), ROBINS-I (for 
    non-randomised studies of interventions), and QUADAS-2 (for diagnostic 
    accuracy studies).
