## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r robsummary}
#Import data 
data_rob <- read.csv("../data/data_rob.csv", header = TRUE)

# Produce summary barchart, detailing % of included studies that were at a given risk of bias for a certain domain of the RoB2.0 tool.
robvis::rob_summary(data_rob, tool = "ROB2", save = "No")
```
