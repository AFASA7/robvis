**UPDATE**: `robvis` now exists as a [web-app](https://mcguinlu.shinyapps.io/robvis), aimed at those who are not familiar with R or who want to explore the package's functionality before installing it locally.


## Description
```{r include = FALSE}
library(robvis)

library(kableExtra)
library(magrittr)
```
The `robvis` package takes the summary table from risk-of-bias assessments and produces plots formatted according to the assessment tool used.

## Getting started

Install the development version which contains new functionality and a range of bug fixes:

```{r, eval=FALSE}   
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mcguinlu/robvis")
```

To update the package, run the `install_github("mcguinlu/robvis")` command again.

If you wish to use the older CRAN version of the package, use the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("robvis")
```

 
### Load data
To load your own data from a .csv file:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mydata <- read.csv("path/to/mydata.csv", header = TRUE)
```

To help users explore `robvis`, we have included example datasets in the package, one for each of the tool templates that currently exist within the package. The `data_rob2` dataset ([view it here](https://github.com/mcguinlu/robvis/blob/master/data_raw/data_rob2.csv)), which contains example risk-of-bias assessments performed using the RoB2.0 tool for randomized controlled trials, is used to create the plots in subsequent sections.

### Create plots  

The package contains two plotting functions:

#### 1. rob_summary()
Returns a ggplot object displaying a weighted barchart of the risk of bias of included studies across the domains of the specified tool. 

```{r, fig.height=3}
summary_rob <- rob_summary(data = data_rob2, tool = "ROB2")
summary_rob
```

#### 2. rob_traffic_light()
Returns a ggplot object displaying a ["traffic light plot"](https://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/chapter_8/figure_8_6_c_example_of_a_risk_of_bias_summary_figure.htm), displaying the risk of bias judgment in each domain for each study.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
trafficlight_rob <- rob_traffic_light(data = data_rob2, tool = "ROB2")
trafficlight_rob
```

``` {r, include=FALSE}
trafficlight_rob <- rob_traffic_light(data = data_rob2, tool = "ROB2")
rob_save(trafficlight_rob,"man/figures/rob2trafficlight.png")
```
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="man/figures/rob2trafficlight.png" width="70%" height="70%"/></div>

### Other functions

#### rob_save()
Pass the `robvis` to this function, along with a destination file, to save your risk-of-bias plots using sensible defaults.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rob_save(trafficlight_rob, "rob_fig.png")
```

#### rob_tools()
Outputs a list of the risk of bias assessment tools for which a template currently exists in rob_summary(). We expect this list to be updated in the near future to include tools such as ROBIS (tool for assessing risk of bias in systematic reviews).

```{r}
rob_tools()
```

## Advanced usage
### Change the colour scheme
The `colour` argument of both plotting functions allows users to select from two predefined colour schemes ("cochrane" or "colourblind") or to define their own palette by providing a vector of hex codes.

For example, to use the predefined "colourblind" palette:

```{r, fig.height=3}
summary_rob <- rob_summary(data = data_rob2,
                           tool = "ROB2",
                           colour = "colourblind")
summary_rob
```

And to define your own colour scheme:
```{r, fig.height=3}
summary_rob <- rob_summary(data = data_rob2,
                           tool = "ROB2",
                           colour = c("#f442c8",
                                      "#bef441",
                                      "#000000",
                                      "#d16684"))
summary_rob
```

### Created an unweighted summary barplot
By default, the `rob_summary()` function creates a barplot weighted by some measure of a study's precision. This can be prevented using the "weighted" argument. For example, compare the following two plots:

```{r, fig.height=3}
summary_rob <- rob_summary(data = data_rob2, tool = "ROB2")
summary_rob
```

```{r, fig.height=3}
summary_rob <- rob_summary(data = data_rob2, tool = "ROB2", weighted = FALSE)
summary_rob
```

### Editing the plots
Finally, because the output (`summary_rob` and `trafficlight_rob` in the examples above) is a ggplot2 object, it is easy to adjust the plot to your own preferences.

For example, to add a title to the unweighted RoB2.0 plot created above:
```{r warning=FALSE, fig.height=3}
library(ggplot2)

summary_rob +
  ggtitle("Summary of RoB2.0 assessments")
```
